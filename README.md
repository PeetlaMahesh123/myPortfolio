# 🤖 AI-Powered Portfolio Assistant

## 🧠 Interactive AI Resume Assistant

This portfolio includes a **custom-built AI Assistant** integrated directly into the website.

The assistant intelligently analyzes my portfolio content and provides real-time answers to user queries such as:

- What technologies does Mahesh know?
- What backend experience does he have?
- Which projects has he built?
- What is his educational background?
- Is he currently open to opportunities?

It functions as an interactive digital resume, allowing visitors and recruiters to engage with my profile dynamically.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Custom-defined system prompt  
- Context-aware response generation  
- Answers strictly based on portfolio data  
- Structured and professional responses  
- Real-time conversational interface  

This demonstrates practical implementation of:

- AI API Integration  
- Prompt Engineering  
- Backend API Handling  
- Conversational UI Development  

---

## ⚠️ API Usage Note

The AI Assistant relies on an external AI API service.

You may occasionally see the message:

> "Exceeded Quota"

This occurs due to API usage limits or rate restrictions set by the AI service provider.

The assistant remains fully functional, but responses may be temporarily unavailable if the quota limit is reached.
